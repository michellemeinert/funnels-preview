# Funnel Previewer

## Overview

Funnel Previewer is a web application designed to provide users with a mobile preview of their funnel JSON files. It allows users to select a funnel JSON file from their computer and generate a visual representation of the funnel as it would appear on a mobile viewport (e.g., 375x600px). Users can navigate between different pages of the funnel, although the preview itself is non-interactive. Additionally, users can upload a new funnel JSON file without reloading the page.

## Features

- Upload a funnel JSON file from your computer.
- Generate a mobile preview of the funnel with a viewport of 375x600px.
- Navigate between different funnel pages.
- Upload a new funnel JSON file without reloading the page.
